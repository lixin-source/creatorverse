## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

** I had to review what I learned in 102 and creating the CSS from scratch was very frustrating, so I used picocss. However, it only applied to some of the elemnents. I also had trouble with my props. In the end, I found that defining their type the way I did solved the problems I had but took a bit of research to do so. Right now, my CSS for some elements are wonky and I plan to fix it in the future.**
